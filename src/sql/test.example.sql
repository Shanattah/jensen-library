-- This file will contain the tests for only one table

-- The schema of a single test should be [test_name, passed]
-- test_name is a string describing what is being tested
-- passed MUST be 0 is test failed or 1 if test passed

-- all tests should be combined in such a way that the result is a table with as many rows as the number
-- of tests written
